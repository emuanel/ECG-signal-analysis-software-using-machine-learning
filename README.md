# ECG-signal-analysis-software-using-machine-learning
BSc Thesis 
The aim of this project was to develop, implement and evaluate software for the analysis
of ECG signals with the use of machine learning. For this purpose, an analysis of similar solutions
was performed and an own implementation was developed and implemented. The proposed
solution uses two trained models of neural networks and a simple graphical interface enabling the
visualization of the results of the algorithms. The method of training data analysis models for
detecting P and T waves and the QRS complex, as well as for analyzing the basic parameters of
the ECG signal such as pulse, lengths of P and T waves, the QRS complex and the R-wave
amplitude was presented. In addition, the software allows you to convert the signal contained in
a .csv file to the WFDB format. The entire project was made in the Python programming language.
Basing on conducted tests it has been proven that all terms have been met and for both neural
networks satisfying prediction results were received.
